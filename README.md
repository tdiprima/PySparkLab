# PySparkLab

PySpark is similar to Pandas in some ways, but it's not exactly like Pandas. Here's a brief description of PySpark:

PySpark is a Python library that provides an interface to Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. PySpark allows you to write Python code that can run on Spark's distributed computing engine, which means you can process large datasets in parallel across a cluster of machines.
